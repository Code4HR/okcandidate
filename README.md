# OKCandidate
Find out which candidates for local offices match with you

OK Candidate is a web app for matching voters with candidates for local offices.

## Problem
Most people don’t know their candidates for local offices. Publishing voter guides is laborious and most voters are not going to take the time to read them. Even the most engaged voters have difficulty determining which candidates to support for some local offices.

## Solution
We propose an app that works like a dating site for matching voters with their candidates. This has been done for presidential elections but never at the local level, where it is most needed.

## Background
A common feature of dating sites is the age-old questionnaire. A group of users is given a list of questions. Potential compatibility between members of the group is calculated based on the user’s responses and the level of importance they have placed in finding someone who shares their views.  We believe the same approach can be taken to match candidates with voters.

## Approach
We are going to publish a platform and web application in which:
- News editors create questions
- Candidates answer the questions
- Voters answer the questions
- Voters see which candidates match their answers best

## Assumptions
- News editors will create questions for every office in an election
- News editors will recruit candidates to answer questions
- News editors and other supporters will promote the app to voters
- Volunteers will build the app

## Installation
```
git clone git@github.com:Code4HR/okcandidate.git
npm install
npm start
```

## Tests
```
npm tests
```
